    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of image preprocessing is to prepare or optimize the images to make further analysis easier. Usually, this boils down to increasing the signal-to-noise ratio by removing noise and background and by enhancing structures of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific preprocessing steps used in a pipeline depend on the type of sample, the microscopy technique used, the image quality, and the desired downstream analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common operations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deconvolution\n",
    "    - Image reconstruction based on information about the PSF of the microscope\n",
    "    - These days deconvolution is often included with microscope software\n",
    "    - *Our example images are not deconvolved, but will do just fine regardless*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conversion to 8-bit images to save memory / computational time\n",
    "    - *Our example images are already 8-bit*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cropping of images to an interesting region\n",
    "    - *The field of view in our example images is fine as it is*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smoothing of technical noise\n",
    "    - This is a very common step and usually helps to improve almost any type of downstream analysis\n",
    "    - Commonly used filters are the `Gaussian filter` and the `median filter`\n",
    "    - *Here we will be using a Gaussian filter.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Corrections of technical artifacts\n",
    "    - Common examples are uneven illumination and multi-channel bleed-through\n",
    "    - *Here we will deal with uneven signal by adaptive/local thresholding*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Background subtraction\n",
    "    - There are various ways of sutracting background signal from an image\n",
    "    - Two different types are commonly distinguished:\n",
    "        - `uniform background subtraction` treats all regions of the image the same\n",
    "        - `adaptive or local background subtraction` automatically accounts for differences between regions of the image\n",
    "    - *Here we will do something similar to adaptive background subtraction when we do adaptive thresholding*"

    "\n",
    "A Gaussian filter smoothens an image by convolving it with a Gaussian-shaped kernel. In the case of a 2D image, the Gaussian kernel is also 2D and will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../session-3to5/ipynb_images/gaussian_kernel_grid.png\" alt=\"Gaussian Kernel Figure\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "How much the image is smoothed by a Gaussian kernel is determined by the standard deviation  of the Gaussian distribution, usually referred to as **sigma** ($\\sigma$). A higher $\\sigma$ means a broader distribution and thus more smoothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to choose the correct value of $\\sigma$?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This depends a lot on your images, in particular on the pixel size. In general, the chosen $\\sigma$ should be large enough to blur out noise but small enough so the \"structures of interest\" do not get blurred too much. Usually, the best value for $\\sigma$ is simply found by trying out some different options and looking at the result. \n"
