# Resources for self-study 

You can access many of the books mentioned below if you have a membership  
at Safari Books Online. You can obtain a membership through the EMBL Szilard library (numbers are limited, not sure whether any are currently available). 

### Basic Python Programming

This really depends on your background and learning style, so I hesitate to give a general suggestion for this. 
However, if you have really good resource for this (book or otherwise) I'm happy to add it here.

### Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Jupyter ("_Data Science_")

There are many books and online resources on these topics available. 
My favourite of these is the book:

[Python Data Science Handbook](https://www.amazon.de/Python-Data-Science-Handbook-Essential/dp/1491912057/ref=sr_1_2?s=books-intl-de&ie=UTF8&qid=1527682495&sr=1-2&keywords=python+data+science&dpID=51MPp7yuZCL&preST=_SX198_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch) by _Jake VanderPlas_
The whole book is available for free [in the form of jupyter notebooks on GitHub](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)

The same author also has a number of very good talks and presentation material on **youtube**. Of particular interest is a series of 10 short videos called 
[Reproducible Data Analysis in Jupyter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZEWDGpM-vM). This will also teach you how to use version control, and package your code.

### Machine Learning in Python

A good introduction to machine learning in Python is

[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques for Building Intelligent Systems](https://www.amazon.de/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291/ref=sr_1_3?s=books-intl-de&ie=UTF8&qid=1527682495&sr=1-3&keywords=python+data+science&dpID=51%252BkYprYK1L&preST=_SX198_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch) by _Auerelien Geron_.


If you want to start with Deep Learning I highly recommend _Francois Chollet's_
[Deep Learning with Python](https://www.amazon.de/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books-intl-de&ie=UTF8&qid=1527683204&sr=1-1-spell&keywords=cholet+deep+learning). 
I found that after reading the first few chapters you will have a fairly good intuition about artificial neural networks.


### Image Processing, Morphological Image Analysis


#### Books 

There are countless books on the concepts of image processing, image analysis and computer vision that explain the underlying math and the physics of image formation. Note that these do not give cookbook recipes, they won't show you how to do stuff.

If you want to get a deep understanding of basics such as image formation, filter kernels (convolutions) and image processing in the frequency domain have a look at "Digital Image Processing" by _Bernd Jähne_, on the shelf in the EMBL Szilard Library. If you are fluent in German, [the original German version](https://www.amazon.de/Digitale-Bildverarbeitung-Bildgewinnung-Bernd-J%C3%A4hne/dp/3642049516) of the book is recommended as it appears to be a more recent edition. This will not teach you the specific tricks of BioImage Analysis, though. 

The field of *morphological image analysis*, or mathematical morphology (including operations such as openings, closings, dilations, erosoions, watersheds and distance transforms) stem from the French school of _Jean Serra_ and  _Georges Matheron_. Much of the original literature is very abstract and may not be easily approachable. There is one book that solidly lays out the foundations but is still somewhat approachable and gives practical examples of what the operators do on images: _Pierre Soille's_ [Engineering
Morphological Image Analysis: Principles and Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Morphological-Image-Analysis-Principles-Applications/dp/3642076963). Unfortuntaly the book is out of print, but the EMBL Szilard Library has one copy of the first edition. 

As an alternative, have a look at the documentation of the [MorphoLibJ](http://imagej.net/MorphoLibJ) ImageJ plugin, which implements many of these methods for ImageJ. 

#### Lectures/Practicals

_Kevin Mader_ from ETH Zürich has excellent material consisting of Slides and Jupyter Notebooks for a lecture [Quantitative Big Imaging](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2018) online.

### BioImage Analysis

#### Books

Kota Miura (former EMBL image analysis specialist) has a textbook specific to BioImage Analysis. You can download the online version for free after registration [here.](https://www.imaging-git.com/applications/bioimage-data-analysis-0?remove_param=true)
